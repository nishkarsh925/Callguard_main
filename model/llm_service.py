        3. CUSTOMER-LED FULFILLMENT: If the Customer provides information or fulfills a requirement before the Agent asks, mark it as PASS. The Agent does not need to repeat it unless necessary for confirmation.
        4. NATURAL CONVERSATION: If the Agent acknowledges or acts upon information provided by the Customer, mark as PASS. (e.g., if Customer says "My battery isn't working" and Agent says "I understand", the "Issue Identification" is a PASS).
        5. POLICY ADHERENCE: If a policy was provided above, ensure the Agent's resolution does not violate any policy constraints.
        6. STATUS OPTIONS:
           - "PASS": Requirement was fully met by either party.
           - "PARTIAL": Requirement was partially met but lacks some detail or confirmation.
